The CLG reader script reads and AidData dataset concerning Chinese loans and grants across the world. This script filters out those 
projects in latin america and the carribbean, and attempts to text mine the projects to find those related to the digital sector. 

The Telecom script finds the words related to the digital sector in order to select the projects that involve the digital sector in 
Latin america. 

The Strategic partnership script attempts to categorize LAC partnerhsips with china from 1 to 4, following a lexical analysis of the descriptions provided by
